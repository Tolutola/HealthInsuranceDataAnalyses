Detailed analyses of health outcome survey by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.(Data is available for authorized users).
According to a recent report from the CommonWealth fund, Americans still pay far more for medical care than people in other rich Western nations but have little to show for all that spending with poor health outcomes including shorter life expectancey and greater prevalence of chronic conditions. Ameicans are sicker and more economically disadvantaged compared to adults in other 10 countries. Health spending is more than $3 trillion per year. Obviously, the health care system needs to be fixed. The big question is how? Data science can provide an unbiased perspective.
This work analyses data collected over a period of 15 years (1998 to 2014) in the Medical Health Outcomes Survey. The survey monitors the health outcomes of individuals over a two-year period. In summary, it as about 3 million records and 200 health features 
Preliminary exploratory data analyses revealed some really interesting trends:
1) In general people have a much lower perception of their health than their actual physical condtion suggests. This perception rarely changes.  
2)The earlier years of the study show relatively better physical than mental health but that switched in the later years. 
3) People less than 65 were twice pessimistic about their health (people’s attitude about their health don’t change much). 
4) Across all categories, blacks faired at least 10% worse that whites and other races
5) Married people consistently better across all categories
6) Unexpected correlation between education and health: better by at least 1 percentage point and improved performance

Other results:
(1)	Usupervised learning  identifies clusters of  demographic and influential factors that could account for the observed health outcomes
(2) A predictive model to estimate future health outcomes, given demographic factors and current health indicators.
